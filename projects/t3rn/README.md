#Project Intrdouction#

t3rn is a smart contract hosting platform that offers an innovative solution to interoperable smart contract execution with fail-safe mechanisms built in, meaning successful multi-chain execution can always be guaranteed. Smart contracts stored in the t3rn registry can be used by anyone, while the developers that contribute smart contracts to the open-source repository can choose to get remunerated anytime their code is executed.

#Wasm contract technical support#

t3rn facilitates interoperable smart contract execution and as such any smart contract that compiles to Wasm can be executed across different blockchains through the t3rn protocol. 


#Developer activity#

t3rn was initially funded by the Web3 Foundation, delivering a full proof of concept in 2020: https://github.com/t3rn/t3rn/blob/development/roadmap/initial_development_phase.md

After fulfilling the grant, t3rn joined the Substrate Builders Program and the Web3.0 Bootcamp to continue further development.
